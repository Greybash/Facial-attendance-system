🎭 Facial Attendance System 📊
This project is a Facial Recognition-based Attendance System that uses OpenCV for face detection and recognition, and Django to display attendance records on a web-based dashboard.

🚀 Features
🏷️ Face Recognition with OpenCV – Detects and recognizes faces in real time.
📄 Automated Attendance Marking – Recognized faces are logged into an attendance CSV file.
🌐 Web-Based Attendance Viewer – Uses Django to display attendance records.
📂 Multiple CSV Support – Attendance data is stored in separate CSV files for easy tracking.
🎛️ User-Friendly Dashboard – A main page with buttons to view different attendance records.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python – Core programming language
OpenCV – Face detection and recognition
Django – Web framework for displaying attendance data
SQLite – Database for storing registered faces (optional)
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap – Frontend for a clean UI
🏗️ How It Works
Face Detection & Recognition: OpenCV captures faces via a webcam and compares them against a trained dataset.
Attendance Logging: Recognized faces are recorded with timestamps in a CSV file.
Web-Based Viewing: Django reads the CSV files and displays attendance data in a structured table.
📌 Future Enhancements
🔄 Live Web Streaming of Attendance
🔒 Secure Authentication for Admins
📈 Data Analytics & Reports
🖥️ Mobile-Friendly Dashboard
